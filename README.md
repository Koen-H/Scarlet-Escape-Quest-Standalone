## Extra information (Spoilers of puzzles ahead)
There are 2 aspects to this game. 1 person will be playing in VR and is able to interact with the world around them, while the second player, will use their phone 
and it's features (such as gyroscope and touch input) to see around the room in a way the player in VR can't. The player on their phone is not able to move on
it's own and needs help from the VR player to look throughout the room.
